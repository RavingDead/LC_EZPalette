Lethal Company modpack for my friends. You know who you are 👁️   👁️ (otherwise, this isn't meant for you).

This aims to make a few additions to the game without being too intrusive.

This modpack also includes preset configurations.

## Major adjustments

### Skinwalker
Only masked enemies will play player voicelines for true immersion :)

### Weather Multipliers
Slight adjustments to mult values:

| **Weather** | **Multipliers** |
|-------------|:---------------:|
| Rainy       | 1.05            |
| Stormy      | 1.2             |
| Foggy       | **_1.2_**       |
| Flooded     | **_1.3_**       |
| Eclipsed    | 1.5             |

## Minor adjustments
- Mirror decor: Made it so the mirror isn't always available (so it feels extra precious)
- Helmet cameras: Framerate for camera reduced to 10fps for performance & style
